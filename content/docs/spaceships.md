# Spaceships

## Introduction

Unfortunately ships were never covered in the core rulebook. This is a list of ships converted for the purposes of being used inside a standard game. Ships featured in SG-1 are prioritised as that is the focus of the RPG. These ships are also compatible with [Starfinder](https://paizo.com/starfinder).
